This an ASCII Font for the Traditional Orthography of Tulu. This uses the AccTantra style of Typing. This font is signicant as it has the glyphs for the necessary sounds and letters which the current unicode ( as of 14th of January, 2025) 
doesnt accomodate.

I intend to keep  the font open source and open to all, with permission to edit it if required as per need. Informing although not required, would be highly honoured.

Any contact with me shall be done by the the email prahladtantry89@gmail.com .
